### Q-DFTNet: Chemistry-Informed Neural Network for Molecular Dipole Prediction

Q-DFTNet is a lightweight, chemistry-informed graph neural network (GNN) framework for predicting molecular dipole moments based on DFT-driven QM9 data. This repository contains implementations of 7 GNN models benchmarked on performance, complexity, and latent space alignment. 

This repository contains a **single, self-contained Python script** that reproduces all key visualizations (performance plots, latent space t-SNE, model complexity vs. accuracy) as presented in the paper.
