### Q-DFTNet: Chemistry-Informed Neural Network for Molecular Dipole Prediction

Q-DFTNet is a modular graph neural network framework developed for predicting molecular dipole moments using quantum chemistry-informed data from the QM9 dataset. It supports multiple GNN architectures including GCN, GIN, GraphConv, SchNet, and hybrid models, and is designed for benchmarking, reproducibility, and easy extensibility.
